### Installation

## Guide

- Start by locating the github which you have done since you are reading this.
- Now, you need to clone this repository into your local machine. This can be done many ways, through your console or directly through an IDE (depends on the IDE obviously). [Here is a link if you need help cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- Once you have the repository cloned all you need to do is open main.py and simply run the program. (NOTE: this program uses the console for input so make sure that you are looking in the console for prompts)
- And lastly, enjoy the program. I hope you find it useful.
